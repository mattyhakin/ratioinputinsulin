Ratio Input Insulin Calculator Project â€“ Matt Hakin

A Simple python-based calculator to work out Insulin dosage.

 Based upon my complexed insulin calculator project (https://github.com/mattyhakin/complexinsulincalc)
 
This calculator can calculator an Insulin dose based on the users ratio for their dose along with the users Blood Glucose readings and the last time they had a dosage of insulin.

The Blood Sugar ranges and correctional dosages are all sorted as variables in the code so can be changed to tailor to the users need and treatment.

The calculator could be useful for  Diabetics who are getting used to the math that comes with working out dosage based upon an ever- changing saturation with ratios. 

In the future I am looking to add in a GUI element to the calculator to make it more user friendly.
